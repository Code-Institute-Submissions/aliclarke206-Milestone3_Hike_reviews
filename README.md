# MileStone Project Three
## Hike Life Review

This project is a simple and responsive design to allow users to easily search, navigate to find new hikes and also to share reviews of hikes that the user may have already completed. The key features of each hike are broken down for quick and easy comparison. Users can also search hikes, locations are available and an email contact service is provided for any concerns or questions.  

## Ux
### Strategy

The basic strategy behind this application was to create a simple and easy to navigate where users could search for hikes in their area or selected county, explore the hikes themselves and then leave a review and recommendations for future hikers. The objective was to create a community for hike lovers to share and recommend the best places or even to avoid. 

**User Stories**

As a user of this application: 

* I would like to search for local hikes.
* Read reviews and recommendations from other users.
* See the location of the hikes.
* See the difficulty of the hikes
* Find information about the distance and amenities such as parking. 
* I would like to be able to leave reviews and add my own recommendations. 
* Be able to contact someone about any issues with any of the content or the hikes. 
* Easy to use on desktop and mobile.
* Simple design with no complicated format. 


### Scope
The specifications and requirements for the site to adhere to the user stories include:
* A search bar to easily find the hike you're looking for
* A form to easily add new hikes
* A contact page for the user to reach out to the site creator.
* Links to social media accounts for more content.
* A link to google maps with the location of the hike 
* A single page with the break down of the key features of the hike such as difficulty and duration. 
* A log in and out function so users have their own page of reviews that they have left.


### Structure
The site is linked with the MongoDB database to allow the user to easily obtain new information correlating with the selected hike. The user can filter through using the search bar and then click each individual hike for more detailed information. The EmailJS functionality makes it easier for the user to make contact.  And the location of the hikes is easily found with the google maps link associated with the hike

### Skeleton
The skeleton of the site was designed to be clean and simple and easy to navigate. The information was largely displayed in bullet point form so the user wasn???t overloaded with information. The user can navigate to a single detail page for the hike for added description and location. The users profile link, login and logout functions, add hike functionality are all displayed in the navigation bar. The navigation bar is also responsive to all screens weather on mobile, tablet or desktop. The card panels are displayed on the main page or users can also filter through using the search function. The skeleton mock ups were roughly done on [Balsamiq WireFrames](https://balsamiq.com/) .

### Surface
The surface of the site should be clean and simple. All the content is well spaced out and not overloaded with graphics and animations. Easy to follow and one main background image with hiking imagery.


## Features
### Existing Features
* Easy, simple design to allow for seamless navigation.
* Hike detail section to see key features of hike in bullet points.
* Ability to customize hike details and add any extra relevant information. 
* Users have their own profile which they can register and create their own password.
* Hikes created by the user can be deleted using the delete hike button and added new hike using the ???add new hike".
* The user can contact the site creator directly by email. EmailJS sends the designated email address to let them know about the query. A screenshot of the recieved image is here [Email correspondence]()
* Location is available through google maps API to compliment the key features of hike om details page.


### Features Left to Implement

* Ability to favourite hikes and/or have a rating poll so hikes could be arranged in order of popularity.
* Ability to interact more with each other as users to create a community amoung the reviewers, such as leaving comments under reviews to allow for more engagement between users to ask questions directly to other users. 
* Adding a weather feature API to link with the location of the hikes so the user would be able to obtain information if it was a good day to visit the hike.
* An ability to add links to other apps. For example, a Fitness wearable if the hike or trail was used for training.
* Use the maps API to show the starting and end point of the hike and also its alternative routes.

## Deployment

The source code for this website was deployed and stored in a GitHub repository while the website application is hosted by Heroku. The two are linked so any new commits or pushes to GitHub's master branch are also updated on the Heroku hosting service. The database for this website is hosted in a cluster on MongoDB.
Link to Heroku live site is [here](https://hike-review-milestone3.herokuapp.com/).

### Heroku Cloud
Heroku service allows for the deployment of our app as a live website, below are the steps required to host a project:

##### Create a new app linked to Github:
* On Heroku website create a user account as required.
* Once registered, click "New" in the top right and "Create App" from the dropdown.
* Choose a name and region and then create app button.
* Once on your new app page, select the "Settings" header and scroll to Config Var. Here you can click "reveal Config Vars" to add new configuration details.
* Assign a variable of 'IP' with a value of '0.0.0.0', next another named 'PORT' with a value of '5000'. 
* Next add any URI, DBNAME, SECRET_KEYS or other variables you do not want to be public.
* From your gitpod/VSCode, create a file named Procfile. Enter 'web: python app.py', to help Heroku assess what sort of app you are creating.
* Next, in the command line type 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' to automatically generate a file with any flask or python tools which are used in creating/using your project.
* Go back to Heroku and select the "Deploy" option. Under "Deployment method", select the "Github: Connect to Github" option.
* Type in the repository which you want to host and search. 
* Once connected, select "Choose branch to deploy" and choose master. Then, click the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button which will enable automatic updates to heroku app.
* Click "Deploy branch".
* The app should now be successfully deployed and any github pushes should also be updated to the heroku app. 

##### How to clone the repository:

* From the GitHub dashboard, chose the repository you wish to clone.
* Click the green ???Code??? button.
* Choose the ???Clone with HTTPS??? clipboard icon.
* Open Git Bash and change the working directory to the location you would like the clone to be.
* Type git clone, and pass the URL you have copied. (Should be in the format $ git clone https://github.com/username/repository.) and click "Enter".

##### Running the application locally:
* Clone the repository as shown above.
* Install the necessary libraries specified in the requirements.txt.
* Create a new file named env.py and add your variables to it.
* Create a gitignore file and include env.py so the information is not oassed to the master branch.
* In your app.py file, 'Import' your env.py file.
* Using 'python3 app.py' in the command line you can run the project.

#### GitHub

A repository was created on GitHub and Gitpod was used to write the code. The code was commited and pushed to Github regularly to ensure it was saved. The GitHub repository was then deployed to GitHub pages by:

1. Logging into GitHub
2. Selecting repositories and then Milestone3_Hike_reviews.
3. Then select settings from the top menu bar.
4. Under GitHub pages
5. Under source, select master branch.
6. The website is now deployed and a link appears for the deployed site.
7. This [link](https://aliclarke206.github.io/Milestone3_Hike_reviews/) can now be cloned and run locally.

### Acknowledgements
The code institute tutorials were very helpful to grasp new concepts and fucntionalitys. Inspiration from hiking sites such as [All Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/) really helped to create some of the UX design. 

Also my mentor, Brian Macharia for helping me along the way!
